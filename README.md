# Data science: Direct marketing optimisation

## Task: Use dummy data to maximise revenue from direct marketing campaigns.

## Data:

-   Social-demographical data (age, gender, tenure in a bank)

-   Products owned + actual volumes (current account, saving account,
    mutual funds, overdraft, credit card, consumer loan)

-   Inflow/outflow on C/A, aggregated card turnover (monthly average
    over past three months)

-   For 60 % of clients, actual sales and revenues from these are
    available (training set)

## Conditions:

The bank has the capacity to contact only 15 pct. of the clients (cca
100 people) with a marketing offer, and each client can be targeted only
once.

## Proposed steps:

1.  Create an analytical dataset (both training and targeting sets)

2.  Develop three propensity models (consumer loan, credit card, mutual
    fund) using the training data set

3.  Optimise targeting clients with the direct marketing offer to
    maximise the revenue

## Expected result:

1.  Which clients have a higher propensity to buy a consumer loan?

2.  Which clients have a higher propensity to buy a credit card?

3.  Which clients have a higher propensity to buy a mutual fund?

4.  Which clients are to be targeted with which offer? General
    description.

5.  What would be the expected revenue based on your strategy?

The executive summary of the analysis should not be larger than two
pages. Attach the technical report, list of clients to be contacted with
which offer, data, algorithms and codes used.
